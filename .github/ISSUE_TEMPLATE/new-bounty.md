Waku Is Uncompromising Web3 Communication at Scale.
A family of robust, censorship-resistant communication protocols, designed to enable privacy-focused messaging for web3 apps.

The JavaScript implementation of Waku, [js-waku](https://github.com/waku-org/js-waku/), enables web apps to utilize the Waku network for off-chain message transmission.

Disclaimer: Waku is **experimental**, you may find blocking issues while developing your web app. We will prioritize their resolution to unblock you, which means you may have to pause development until done.
Thank you for your patience and understanding.
